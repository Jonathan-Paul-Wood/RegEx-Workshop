# RegEx-Workshop
a basic introduction to regex, with a few examples

See the .png for why RegEx matters

Read the rules folder for basic overview of common Regular Expressions, and links to more resources

In each of the remaining folders, the 'answers.txt' contain the strings you should match for, the 'hint.txt' contains 
the RegEx that will make those matches (or at least a valid RegEx), and the last file contains the strings you need to sort through.

Have fun!
